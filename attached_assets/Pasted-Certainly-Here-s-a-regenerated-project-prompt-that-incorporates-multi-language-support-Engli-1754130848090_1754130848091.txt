## 📝 **Regenerated Prompt for Cannabis Inventory and Sales Tracking App (Offline, Multilingual)**

### 🎯 **Project Overview**

The app will support cannabis retailers in managing products, recording sales, conducting audits, and generating reports — all in compliance with cannabis industry regulations. The user interface must be simple, intuitive, and accessible to users in different regions and languages.
